# Contact-Master-Effortless-Contact-Management-with-Memory

***This contact book features a user-friendly graphical interface, offering a range of capabilities including adding, editing, and deleting individual contacts.***

The main window displays all your saved contacts, accessible through key functions. 

When you click 'Add,' a new window opens where you can input the necessary personal information for saving a contact. It's mandatory to provide at least the first name and surname for saving, and it's important to note that contacts with identical first and last names cannot be saved. 

For editing or deleting contacts, you must first select the desired person. The search function enables you to look up information such as email addresses, phone numbers, or partial names, presenting results in a list. Once you've completed your tasks, simply close the application, and all your contact changes will be saved.
